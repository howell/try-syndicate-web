;; Role: SELLER
;;  - when interest in (book-quote $title _) appears,
;;    asserts (book-quote title (Option Float)), #f meaning not available,
;;    and otherwise an asking-price.
;;  - when interest in (order $title $offer-price _ _) appears,
;;    asserts (order title offer-price #f #f) for "no sale", otherwise
;;    (order title offer-price PositiveInteger String), an accepted sale.

;; Role: BUYER
;;  - observes (book-quote title $price) to learn prices.
;;  - observes (order title offer-price $id $delivery-date) to make orders.

;; Role: SPLIT-PROPOSER
;;  - observes (split-proposal title asking-price contribution $accepted?)
;;    to make a split-proposal and learn whether it was accepted or not.

;; Role: SPLIT-DISPOSER
;;  - when interest in (split-proposal $title $asking-price $contribution _)
;;    appears, asserts (split-proposal title asking-price contribution #t)
;;    to indicate they are willing to go through with the deal, in which case
;;    they then perform the role of BUYER for title/asking-price, or asserts
;;    (split-proposal title asking-price contribution #f) to indicate they
;;    are unwilling to go through with the deal.
